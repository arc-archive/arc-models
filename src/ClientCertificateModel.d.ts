/**
 * Events based access to client-certificates data store.
 *
 * Note: **All events must be cancelable.** When the event is cancelled by an instance
 * of the element it won't be handled again by other instance that possibly exists
 * in the DOM.
 *
 * Cancellable event is a request to models for change. Non-cancellable event
 * is a notification for views to update their values.
 * For example `request-object-changed` event notifies model to update object in
 * the datastore if the event is cancelable and to update views if it's not
 * cancellable.
 *
 * Each handled event contains the `result` property on the `detail` object. It
 * contains a `Promise` object with a result of the operation. Also, for update / delete
 * events the same non-cancelable event is fired.
 *
 * Events handled by this element are cancelled and propagation of the event is
 * stopped.
 *
 * The certificates are located in the `client-certificates-data` store.
 * Content is not stored with the listing data for performance.
 *
 * `clientCertificate` structure
 * - `type` {String} - Certificate type. Either p12 or pem. Required.
 * - `cert` {Array<Certificate>} or {Certificate} - Certificate or list of certificates to use. Required.
 * - `key` {Array<Certificate>} or {Certificate} - Key for pem certificate. Optional.
 * - `name` {String} - Custom name of the certificate. Optional.
 * - `created` {Number} - Timestamp when the certificate was inserted into the data store.
 * Required when returning a result. Auto-generated when inserting.
 *
 * `Certificate` structure
 * - `data` {String} or {ArrayBuffer} or {Buffer} The certificate to use. Required.
 * The p12 type certificate must be a Buffer. The `get()` method always returns
 * original data type.
 * - `passphrase` {String} - A passphrase to use to unlock the certificate. Optional.
